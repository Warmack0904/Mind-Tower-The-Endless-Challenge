# Mind-Tower-The-Endless-Challenge
Mind Tower: The Endless Challenge is a minimalist offline browser game where you climb an infinite tower by choosing doors each floor. Behind them: traps, loops, or ascents. With only 3 lives and increasing difficulty, every decision counts. No downloads, no internet â€” just pure strategy and luck.
